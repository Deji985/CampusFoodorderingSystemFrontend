## Campus Food Ordering System

This project is a simple web app for students to order food from the school canteen.

### Features

- **Add to cart**: Select items and see them in the cart.
- **Place orders**: Submit an order and view order status.
- **User accounts**: Register, log in, edit profile, or delete account.

### How to Run
- **Open** `index.html` in a web browser (double-click the file).
- **Make sure** the `css`, `images`, and `script.js` files stay in the same folder as `index.html`.

### Folder Contents
- **HTML files**: Pages like `index.html`, `menu.html`, `cart.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`.
- **css**: Styles for the pages.
- **images**: Logos and food pictures.
- **script.js**: Front-end logic (cart, orders, and interactions).
